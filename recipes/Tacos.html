      <h4>Steps</h4>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Prepare the dried chilies by removing stems and seeds, then toast them
          lightly in a dry skillet.
        </li>
        <li>
          Boil the chilies in water until softened, then blend with garlic,
          onions, vinegar, oregano, cinnamon, bay leaves, salt, and pepper to
          make a smooth marinade.
        </li>
        <li>
          Coat the beef with the marinade and refrigerate overnight for flavors
          to meld.
        </li>
        <li>
          Slow-cook the marinated beef in a Dutch oven or slow cooker until
          tender and easily shredded.
        </li>
        <li>
          Remove the beef, shred it with forks, and strain the cooking liquid
          for dipping.
        </li>
        <li>
          Warm tortillas, then fill each with shredded beef, serve with consomm√©
          for dipping, and enjoy with optional toppings.
